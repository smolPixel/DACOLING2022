it 's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf .	0
it 's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads .	0
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	0
the movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .	0
more dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .	0
but it 's hardly a necessary enterprise .	0
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .	0
the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .	0
a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .	0
sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca n't save it .	0
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn .	0
the film has a kind of hard , cold effect .	0
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .	0
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni 's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .	0
what little grace -lrb- rifkin 's -rrb- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .	0
terrible .	0
to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .	0
here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha .	0
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject	0
things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .	0
rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .	0
should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .	0
it 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .	0
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .	0
but the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .	0
a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .	0
busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .	0
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld -lrb- who is also one of the film 's producers -rrb- do everything he can to look like a good guy .	0
dismally dull sci-fi comedy .	0
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .	0
this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .	0
-lrb- n -rrb- o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .	0
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .	0
none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .	0
they presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .	0
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special .	0
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory .	0
no better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater .	0
like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .	0
one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .	0
the plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	0
mr. deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .	0
-lrb- soderbergh -rrb- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .	0
i never thought i 'd say this , but i 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !	0
too much of storytelling moves away from solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .	0
just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .	0
unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .	0
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .	0
-lrb- a -rrb- crushing disappointment .	0
a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard .	0
the film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind .	0
too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .	0
bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .	0
it 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .	0
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .	0
` god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '	0
the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .	0
degenerates into hogwash .	0
... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .	0
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .	0
an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .	0
he 's not good with people .	0
there 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	0
deserving of its critical backlash and more .	0
the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .	0
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .	0
the great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home .	0
when not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .	0
it 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah .	0
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .	0
i 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake .	0
it 's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .	0
it 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .	0
lurid and less than lucid work .	0
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .	0
not once does it come close to being exciting .	0
all of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .	0
that 's because relatively nothing happens .	0
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .	0
the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .	0
lush and beautifully photographed -lrb- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -rrb- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	0
this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	0
nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .	0
and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .	0
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .	0
an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .	0
oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material	0
never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca n't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .	0
for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .	0
as the mediterranean sparkles , ` swept away ' sinks .	0
at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .	0
a movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .	0
the re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .	0
illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .	0
at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it	0
too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel .	0
as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .	0
worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .	0
mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame .	0
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	0
the pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .	0
does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films .	0
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago ...	0
quite frankly , i ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .	0
here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .	0
while the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .	0
a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .	0
problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .	0
bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .	0
an ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .	0
a processed comedy chop suey .	0
a gushy episode of `` m \* a \* s \* h '' only this time from an asian perspective .	0
as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .	0
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .	0
a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '	0
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .	0
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .	0
how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?	0
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .	0
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .	0
set in a 1986 harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in new york .	0
crummy .	0
like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .	0
without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .	0
even murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .	0
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .	0
for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .	0
it 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless .	0
the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .	0
instead of trying to bust some blondes , -lrb- diggs -rrb- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .	0
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .	0
what we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .	0
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .	0
it is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .	0
... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .	0
it 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .	0
the problem with all of this : it 's not really funny .	0
men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .	0
`` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time .	0
too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .	0
an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .	0
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .	0
the film is strictly routine .	0
watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .	0
the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .	0
it 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful .	0
technically and artistically inept .	0
into how long is this movie ?	0
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .	0
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .	0
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .	0
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	0
anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .	0
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .	0
since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .	0
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .	0
kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .	0
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .	0
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .	0
noyce 's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us	0
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .	0
comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .	0
it never rises to its clever what-if concept .	0
... really horrible drek .	0
a complete waste of time .	0
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown .	0
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .	0
there 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .	0
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .	0
contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .	0
if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .	0
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .	0
... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .	0
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .	0
as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile .	0
it 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .	0
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .	0
do n't say you were n't warned .	0
it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see .	0
festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	0
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .	0
extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten .	1
it 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .	1
the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .	1
smart and taut .	1
this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air .	1
-lrb- reno -rrb- delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .	1
in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .	1
interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .	1
does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story .	1
intimate and panoramic .	1
pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film .	1
a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .	1
predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell .	1
delight your senses and crash this wedding !	1

the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino .	1
this is the stuff that disney movies are made of .	1

nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .	1
thoroughly enjoyable .	1
uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof .	1
the writing is clever and the cast is appealing .	1
connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .	1
a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 .	1
... in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it does n't disappoint .	1
gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years .	1

the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann .	1
i liked it just enough .	1
by and large this is mr. kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since the doors .	1
this is a superior horror flick .	1
a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .	1
while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you wo n't care .	1
a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you can not separate them .	1
the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting .	1
we 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again .	1
if it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .	1
do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .	1
better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift .	1
special p.o.v. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen .	1
steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic .	1
the best film of the year 2002 .	1
the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .	1
road to perdition does display greatness , and it 's worth seeing .	1
the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable .	1
a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .	1
a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france 's most inventive directors .	1
highly engaging .	1
a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .	1
a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it 's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow .	1
-lrb- stephen -rrb- earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .	1
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest .	1
the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .	1

a taut , sobering film .	1
a tour de force of modern cinema .	1
like all of egoyan 's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .	1

a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc .	1
just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .	1
all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .	1

he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper .	1
a film of delicate interpersonal dances .	1
mr. spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned .	1

handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .	1
australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them .	1
the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .	1
the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .	1
cho 's timing is priceless .	1
exhilarating but blatantly biased .	1
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .	1

a movie of riveting power and sadness .	1
a wildly entertaining scan of evans ' career .	1

affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .	1

about schmidt is nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear .	1
huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women 's augustine .	1
and , there 's no way you wo n't be talking about the film once you exit the theater .	1
anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed .	1
as an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .	1
a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters .	1
stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .	1

the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .	1
a riveting story well told .	1

exciting documentary .	1
